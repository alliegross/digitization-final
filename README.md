# digitization-final

This is our final project for Digitization: From Object to Data by Alexandra Gross, Megiel Kerkhoven, and Casper Van Der Vliet. In this project we studied the question: does a certain network of these parties tend to vote together in the Dutch Parliament from 2013-2016? Our data curation files contain the original file as an xls, and two times syntax (.sps and .rtf) and two times curated data (.sav (spss) and .xls) to ensure you are able to open the files. Thanks for a great course!
